Analyzing Weather Data and Forecasting Temperatures:

In this project, I explored the world of weather data analysis and temperature forecasting using a variety of data science techniques. I started by cleaning a dataset of weather data from London, England, spanning from 1979 to 2020. This dataset included information on various weather parameters, such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed.

Next, I performed various data preprocessing steps to prepare the data for analysis and modeling. This included handling missing values and scaling the data to a standard range.

To analyze the temporal patterns in the weather data, I employed time series analysis techniques. I used time-based interpolation to fill in missing values and smoothed the data using moving averages. This allowed me to identify trends and seasonality in the weather data.

For temperature forecasting, I utilized a combination of machine learning and statistical modeling approaches. I first trained a linear regression model to predict daily mean temperatures based on historical weather data. The model achieved an R-squared value of 0.974, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual temperatures.

To improve the forecasting accuracy, I implemented a recurrent neural network (RNN) model, specifically a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. LSTMs are well-suited for time-series forecasting tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in the data. The LSTM model achieved an MAE value of 0.02, outperforming the linear regression model.

Finally, I evaluated the performance of both models on a holdout dataset and analyzed the results. The LSTM model consistently outperformed the linear regression model, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning for weather forecasting.

Overall, this project provided valuable insights into the analysis and forecasting of weather data using various data science techniques. The findings can be applied to develop more accurate weather forecasting models and inform decision-making in various sectors, such as agriculture, transportation, and energy.
